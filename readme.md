# What is this?
This is nothing more then a project for me to get good at golang.

## What does the bot do
Read the source code.

## Whats up with butch?
Currently, all previous sections have been fully reimplemented, especially the rsvp system, which is actually usable now. *four*, or the 4chan module had the least work put into it. I simply moved the post2Embed to boolbox, generalized it a bit, and left the rest of the code basically untouched. So its still as ugly and as not worky as it was before. Soon that will be taken care of as well. But I'm writing this a 0400, so ill sign off.

#FQA - Frequently Questioned Answers

+ Why does this use [arikawa](https://github.com/diamondburned/arikawa) and not [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo) or [disgord](https://github.com/andersfylling/disgord)?

	• Because arikawa is a lot simpler, more elegant, and just generally a better structured api.

+ Why do you use [your fork of godesu](https://github.com/lordrusk/godesu) instead of the original [godesu](https://github.com/mtarnawa/godesu)?

	• There are a few problems that need to be fixed, and some improvements that I'm planning on implementing into my fork. At some point it will become it's own project, seperate from the original. But until I have time to develope my own, I'll just use this simple fork.
